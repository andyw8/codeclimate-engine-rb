# codeclimate-engine-rb

A simple way to create issues in the JSON format described in the [Code Climate Engine specification].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'codeclimate_engine'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install codeclimate_engine

## Usage

```ruby
location = CCEngine::Location::LineRange.new(
  path:       "foo/bar.txt",
  line_range: 13..14
)

issue = CCEngine::Issue.new(
  check_name:  "Bug Risk/Unused Variable",
  description: "Unused local variable `foo`",
  categories:  [CCEngine::Category.complexity, CCEngine::Category.style],
  location:    location
)

issue.to_json
```

The result would be:

```json
{
  "type": "issue",
  "check_name":  "Bug Risk/Unused Variable",
  "description": "Unused local variable `foo`",
  "categories":  ["Complexity", "Style"],
  "location": {
    "path": "foo/bar.txt",
    "lines": {
      "begin": 13,
      "end":   14
    }
  }
}
```

There are some other ways to specify the location â€“ please browse the gem's
tests for details.

Code Climate requires that each issue is terminated with a null character.
Calling `render` on an issue will output the issue's JSON, followed by a null
character.
